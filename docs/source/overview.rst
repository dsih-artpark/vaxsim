Overview
========

VAXSIM is a Python package for simulating Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) control through vaccination using an SIRSV (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, Susceptible-vaccinated) model. It enables the modelling of pulsed vaccination campaigns with customisable coverage, duration, and periodicity. The package also accounts for immunity waning over time, allowing users to adjust vaccination parameters, disease transmission rates, and recovery dynamics. Outputs include detailed time-series data on population dynamics, supporting decision-making and policy evaluation.
